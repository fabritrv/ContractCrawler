# ContractCrawler
Crawler that gets verified contracts from Etherscan.

To run it a csv containing the address of the contracts is needed. If you need access to this file email-me.
You will also need an API key.


TO RUN THE CRAWLER:
Uncomment reader_scraper if you want to scrape directly from the website, or uncomment reader_getter if you want to use Etherscan's API.
